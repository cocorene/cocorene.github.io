Over the past few days I've been teaching myself the ins and outs of GitHub. While I'm at ease designing in Photoshop and coding in Brackets, I was terrified to make that leap to the "terminal" to use Git and GitHub. Well, I'm glad to share it wasn't as hard or as intimidating as I thought. Now I'm using GitHub Pages to create this website and blog powered by Jekyll. This lets me use Markdown to author my posts. I think that's pretty cool!
